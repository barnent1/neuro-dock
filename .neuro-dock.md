# NeuroDock: AI-Orchestrated Agile Development System

## 🎯 Overview

NeuroDock is an AI-orchestrated development system that breaks down software projects into manageable, trackable tasks following agile development methodology. It enables AI agents to systematically build complete projects while maintaining human oversight and intervention capabilities.

### 🌟 Key Concepts

- **Agent Orchestration**: AI Navigator uses NeuroDock commands to orchestrate project development
- **Task Execution**: AI NeuroDock (LLM backend) executes individual development tasks
- **Human Oversight**: Developers observe and guide the process with contextual interventions
- **Agile Workflow**: Follows standard agile development cycles with clear phases
- **Incremental Progress**: Every action is tracked, recorded, and can be resumed

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new project
nd init

# 2. Gather and clarify requirements
echo "Build a task management web app with user authentication" | nd requirements

# 3. Plan the sprint with task breakdown
nd sprint-plan

# 4. Create technical design documents
nd design

# 5. Start development iteration
nd develop

# 6. Run automated tests
nd test

# 7. Deploy to staging/production

## 🧠 AI Agent Integration Guide

### For AI Agent 1 (Project Orchestrator)

When an AI agent receives a project request:

1. **Parse the Request**: Extract project requirements, constraints, and goals
2. **Initialize Project**: Run `nd init` to set up project structure
3. **Gather Requirements**: Use `nd requirements` with piped input or interactive mode
4. **Plan Sprint**: Execute `nd sprint-plan` to break down work
5. **Iterate Through Development**:
   ```bash
   while tasks_remaining; do
     nd develop --interactive
     nd test
     human_review_checkpoint
   done
   ```
6. **Deploy and Review**: Complete with `nd deploy` and `nd retrospective`

### For AI Agent 2 (Task Executor)

The LLM backend receives context-rich prompts including:
- Current project specification
- Task requirements and constraints
- Existing codebase and architecture
- Development best practices
- Previous task completion history

### Human Intervention Points

Developers can intervene at any stage:
- **Requirements Phase**: Clarify or add requirements
- **Planning Phase**: Adjust task priorities or breakdown
- **Development Phase**: Provide additional context or constraints
- **Review Phase**: Approve or request changes
- **Deployment Phase**: Control release timing and scope

your development partner who will guide you through the complete Agile process. 
I work with NeuroDock (our memory and technical agent) to ensure nothing is lost 
and everything builds on our previous conversations.

Let's begin! What's your project vision? I'll help clarify requirements, 
plan the work, and coordinate the technical execution while keeping you 
informed every step of the way."

Developer: [Describes project idea]

Navigator: "Excellent! Let me engage our discuss system to gather detailed 
requirements. I'll relay any questions from NeuroDock to you and ensure 
your answers are properly stored in our memory system..."

[Navigator runs nd discuss internally]
[NeuroDock generates questions]

Navigator: "NeuroDock has identified some key areas that need clarification:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

Please answer these, and I'll feed them back to ensure complete understanding."

Developer: [Provides answers]

Navigator: "Perfect! I'm storing your answers in our memory system and 
updating the requirements. Now let's move to planning..."
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

NeuroDock automatically tracks:
- **Task Completion**: Percentage of tasks completed
- **Code Quality**: Automated code analysis metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration test coverage
- **Deployment Status**: Environment deployment states
- **Timeline Adherence**: Actual vs. estimated completion times

## 🔄 Iterative Development

### Sprint Cycles
```bash
# Start new sprint
nd sprint-plan --new

# Daily development cycle
for day in {1..10}; do
  nd develop --daily-goal
  nd test --quick
  nd progress --daily-standup
done

# End sprint
nd review --sprint-review
nd retrospective
```

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Automated workflow
nd develop --watch | nd test --continuous | nd deploy --staging
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Degradation
- Database connection failures fall back to local file storage
- LLM unavailability provides manual task execution guidance
- Network issues enable offline development mode

### Recovery Commands
```bash
nd recover --from-backup      # Restore from last known good state
nd repair --database          # Fix database inconsistencies
nd sync --remote              # Synchronize with remote repositories
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### LLM Backend Configuration
```yaml
# .neuro-dock/config.yaml
llm:
  provider: ollama              # ollama, openai, anthropic
  model: openchat              # Model for task execution
  temperature: 0.3             # Creativity vs. consistency
  context_window: 8192         # Maximum context size
```

### Database Configuration
```yaml
database:
  type: postgresql             # postgresql, sqlite
  url: postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
  memory_retention: 30d        # How long to keep task history
```

### Memory System Configuration
```yaml
memory:
  vector_store: qdrant         # qdrant, pinecone, weaviate
  embedding_model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
  similarity_threshold: 0.7
```

## 🎯 Best Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Context Preservation
Always maintain context between commands:
```bash
# Good: Maintains project context
nd requirements && nd sprint-plan && nd develop

# Avoid: Losing context between sessions
cd different-project && nd develop
```

### 2. Human Checkpoint Integration
Implement regular human review points:
```bash
nd develop --checkpoint-after=3-tasks
nd review --require-human-approval
```

### 3. Incremental Progress
Make small, verifiable progress:
```bash
nd develop --task="single-feature"  # Not entire application
nd test --unit                       # Test each increment
```

### 4. Error Recovery
Plan for and handle errors gracefully:
```bash
if ! nd develop --task="complex-feature"; then
  nd breakdown "complex-feature"
  nd develop --task="simple-subtask"
fi
```
