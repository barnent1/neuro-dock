## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurodock.git
cd neurodock

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the system
python -m neurodock.cli setup

# Initialize your first project
python -m neurodock.cli init
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurodock.git
cd neurodock

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the system (includes database configuration)
nd setup

# Initialize your first project
nd init
```

### Your First AI-Guided Project

```bash
# Start an enhanced iterative discussion
nd discuss

# The system will:
# 1. Generate context-aware clarifying questions
# 2. Wait for Navigator to facilitate conversation with developer
# 3. Accept answers and analyze completeness
# 4. Generate follow-up questions if needed
# 5. Repeat until all requirements are crystal clear
# 6. Generate comprehensive task plan

# Navigator commands for iterative discussions:
nd discuss-status     # Check current discussion state
echo "answers..." | nd discuss-answer  # Provide developer responses
```

### Enhanced Iterative Workflow Example

```bash
Developer: "Build a Next.js e-commerce site"

System: Generates specific questions about features, technical requirements, success criteria...

Navigator: Facilitates conversation, collects detailed answers

System: Analyzes completeness, generates follow-up questions if needed

Navigator: Continues iteration until 100% clarity achieved

Result: Comprehensive specification and detailed task plan ready for development
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The Enhanced Iterative Discussion Approach

1. **Intelligent Question Generation**: System analyzes project description and generates context-specific clarifying questions
2. **Navigator Facilitation**: Navigator asks developer questions and collects comprehensive answers
3. **Completeness Analysis**: AI analyzes answers to determine if more clarification is needed
4. **Follow-up Iteration**: System generates additional questions based on previous answers if gaps exist
5. **Memory Integration**: All conversations stored with full context for future reference
6. **Task Plan Generation**: When complete, generates detailed implementation plan

### Discussion States & Flow

```
new → questions_pending → awaiting_answers → (iteration) → ready_for_planning
  ↓           ↓                ↓                ↓              ↓
Init     Navigator         System          More Q&A?     Final Plan
       Collects          Analyzes         If needed     Generation
       Answers          Completeness
```

### Navigator Commands

```bash
# Check what action Navigator should take
nd discuss-status

# Provide developer answers to continue iteration
echo "detailed answers to all questions" | nd discuss-answer

# View discussion history and memory
nd memory --search="discussion"
```
