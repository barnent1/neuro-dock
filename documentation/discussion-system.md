# Enhanced Iterative Discussion System

## Overview

The Enhanced Iterative Discussion System supports multi-round conversations between Developer ‚Üí Navigator ‚Üí NeuroDock until all project requirements are fully clarified and resolved.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Iteration Support**
- Supports unlimited rounds of questions and answers
- Each iteration builds on previous conversations
- Automatic detection when discussion is complete

### 2. **State Management**
- Persistent discussion state across sessions
- Progress tracking and completion estimation
- Conversation history preservation

### 3. **Navigator Integration**
- Navigator can check discussion status
- Navigator provides developer answers to system
- Intelligent handoff between phases

### 4. **Completeness Analysis**
- AI-powered analysis of discussion completeness
- Automatic generation of follow-up questions
- Ensures all critical information is captured

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Questions
```bash
nd discuss
```
- Generates first round of clarifying questions
- Saves questions for Navigator to handle
- Sets status to "questions_pending"

### Phase 2: Navigator Handles Questions
```bash
nd discuss-status  # Check what questions are pending
```
Navigator asks developer the questions and collects answers.

### Phase 3: Provide Answers
```bash
echo "Developer's answers..." | nd discuss-answer
```
- Navigator pipes developer answers back to system
- System analyzes completeness
- Generates follow-up questions if needed

### Phase 4: Iteration (if needed)
Process repeats until all questions resolved:
- Additional clarifying questions generated
- Navigator handles new questions with developer
- Answers provided back to system
- Completeness re-analyzed

### Phase 5: Final Planning
When discussion is complete:
- Comprehensive specification compiled
- Task plan generated
- Ready for development phase

## Discussion States

### `new`
- Fresh project, no discussion started
- **Next Action**: Run `nd discuss`

### `questions_pending`
- Questions generated, waiting for Navigator/Developer
- **Next Action**: Navigator asks questions, collects answers

### `awaiting_answers`
- Answers received, system processing next steps
- **Next Action**: System determines if more questions needed

### `ready_for_planning`
- Discussion complete, ready for task generation
- **Next Action**: Generate final task plan

## Navigator Commands

### Check Discussion Status
```bash
nd discuss-status
```
Returns:
- Current status and iteration
- Completion percentage
- Next recommended action
- Pending questions (if any)

### Provide Answers
```bash
echo "Complete answers to all questions..." | nd discuss-answer
```
- Processes developer answers
- Continues discussion iteration
- Returns next status

### Monitor Progress
```bash
nd memory --search="discussion"  # Search discussion history
nd status                        # Overall project status
```

## Example Complete Workflow

### 1. Navigator Initiates Discussion
```bash
# Navigator starts discussion with NeuroDock
echo "Build a modern e-commerce website with product catalog and user auth" | nd discuss
```

### 2. Check Questions Generated
```bash
nd discuss-status
```
Output:
```

============================================================
```

### 6. Continue Until Complete
Process repeats until:
```bash
‚úÖ Discussion complete! All questions resolved.
üéØ Ready to generate comprehensive task plan...

üéâ Discussion and planning completed successfully!
üí° Next steps:
  ‚Ä¢ Review task plan: nd plan
  ‚Ä¢ Start executing tasks: nd run
```

## Best Practices

### For Navigator
1. **Ask Open Questions First**: Let developer elaborate before narrowing down
2. **Confirm Understanding**: Reflect back what you heard before proceeding
3. **Dive Deep on Ambiguity**: Don't accept vague answers on critical points
4. **Track Decisions**: Explicitly confirm important choices

### For Developers

2. **Think Ahead**: Consider edge cases and future requirements
3. **Ask Questions**: Clarify anything unclear about the process
4. **Take Time**: Don't rush through important decisions

This enhanced system ensures that by the time development begins, everyone has complete clarity and confidence in the project direction.
